# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack timing sidechannel in the `rsa` crate.
# The `rsa` crate is a transitive dependency of `ssh-key` (used for OpenSSH
# key format parsing). We only extract raw RSA key components and rebuild
# them via OpenSSL — we never perform RSA encryption/decryption through
# this crate, so the timing sidechannel does not apply.
